# Websocket Protocol

Websocket Protocol is a network protocol that uses Godot's [`WebSocketMultiplayerPeer`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_websocketmultiplayerpeer.html). Great option if you planned to export your game as HTML5.

## Secure Connections
Websocket Network Protocol comes with secure options out of the box. You can read more guides at [Encryption](/docs/manual/encryption).
