# MultiPlay Core Roadmap

MultiPlay Core's journey is just starting to begin! Here's the list of what I would love to implement.

## Main quests
- [x] [MPAuth](/docs/manual/auth) - Authenticator... is done!
- [ ] MPTransformSync - Sync node transforms with lerp.
- [ ] MPMovement - Sync Character2D/3D movement, allowing for user movement input while maintaining server authority.
- [ ] MPRigidbody - Sync physics state in the network.
- [ ] MPStartTransform - Spawn position for players.
- [ ] MPDiscovery - Find available online rooms in the network.
- [ ] Custom Network Protocol - Support more network methods such as P2P, alongside alternative services such as Steam, Jam Launch, GD-Sync, etc.
- [ ] Encryption - Securely send data between server <-> client

## Side quests
- [ ] Dedicated server hosting - Self-hosted Backend server that manages MultiPlay Core instances.

Any more ideas are appreciated!
